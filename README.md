# Data-Analysis
 
 This is a repo for the data analysis project of Tree Survival Prediction and Tree Stereility Prediction.

 ## Index

 1. [Model 1 - Domain Knowledge](m1.ipynb) - This notebook is for the tree survival prediction analysis based on just domain knowledge and research.

 2. [Model 2- Grid Search CV](m2.ipynb) - This notebook is for the tree survival prediction analysis by selecting features using Grid Search CV.

 3. [Model 3 - Tree Sterility Prediction](m3.ipynb) - This notebook is for creating a model that classifies if the soil is sterile using KNN.

 4. [Exploratory Data Analysis](EDA.ipynb) - This notebook is for the exploratory data analysis of the data.
